// Codex `/init` prompt — mirrors `codex-rs/tui/prompt_for_init_command.md`
// from the OpenAI Codex CLI source tree. Codex's interactive `/init` command
// submits this prompt as a user message; the model then inspects the repo
// (e.g. via `git ls-files`) and writes AGENTS.md using its file tools.
//
// AgentCabin runs Codex in `exec` mode (non-interactive), so the CLI's own
// `/init` is unreachable — we replicate the behaviour at the app layer.
//
// Sync from upstream when Codex CLI updates this prompt. Last sync:
//   codex-main @ 2026-02 — prompt_for_init_command.md (41 lines)
