// AgentCabin-authored review prompts — Codex TUI's `/review` uses a picker UI
// rather than a prompt-injection file, so there is no upstream `prompt_for_
// review_command.md` to mirror like CODEX_INIT_PROMPT does. We mirror the four
// Codex presets (uncommitted / base branch / commit / custom) as prompts and let
// the model use its bash + read tools to gather the diff.
//
// Tone matches CODEX_INIT_PROMPT: tell the model what to run and what to report.

// Shared read-only guard + per-change report + severity grouping, appended to
// each preset's "what to inspect" section.
