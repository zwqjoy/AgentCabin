//! Transport-agnostic session protocol abstraction.
//!
//! `SessionActor` owns a long-lived child process and a bidirectional pipe. The wire
//! format differs by agent — Claude speaks stream-json + control_request/response, Codex
//! speaks `app-server` JSON-RPC — but the actor's loop (mailbox, timeouts, quarantine,
//! cancel, ralph, stdin ownership) is identical. This trait localizes every wire-format
//! difference so the actor stays protocol-neutral.
//!
//! Implementations: [`crate::agent::codex_appserver::CodexAppServer`] (and, as the refactor
//! lands, a `ClaudeStreamJson` wrapper over the existing `ProtocolState`).
